/* A virtual destructor is a virtual function defined in the base class of a derived class. A virtual destructor is used such that proper cleanup in the allocated memory is achieved. Such use is required when an object or a class of the derived class is manipulated through the base class's pointer and both the superclass and sub-class have dynamic memory allocations; This implies that there is run-time polymorphism. However, there is no need of virtual destructor if and only if the derived class is not manipulated through the base class's pointer; In this case memory allocation will be properly deallocated.
 
 Concisely, a class with run-time polymorphism (virtual functions) needs to have virtual destructor.
 
 Example: Consider a derived class B having a base class A such that memory is allocated in both A and B. Expression like:
 A* obj = new B();  // manipulation of derived class through the base class
 delete obj;
 To achieve the desired memory deallocation, the destructor in base class A should be made virtual and as such proper cleanups can be achieved in B.
